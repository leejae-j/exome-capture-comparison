Analyzing subtype call differences between a whole-transcriptome RNA-seq method and a commercial exome-capture assay

**Data availability:**

* Survival data with subtype calls from whole transcriptome and exome capture RNA-seq can be found in **clinical_data.csv**
* Subtype calls with basal-like probability by NanoString vs. RNA-seq from the trial cohort can be found in **pancreas_trial_samples.csv**
