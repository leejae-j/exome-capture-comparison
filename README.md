## Exome capture comparison analysis

Codes corresponding to all analyses and figure generation in:

Lee, J.J. *et al*. Cross-platform comparison of gene expression-based cancer molecular subtyping reveals discrepancies with exome capture methods. *NPJ Precis Oncol* (2025).


Analyzing subtype call differences between a whole-transcriptome RNA-seq method and a commercial exome-capture assay.

**Data availability:**

* TPM files and deidentified survival data with subtype calls from whole transcriptome and exome capture RNA-seq can be downloaded from GSE***.
* Subtype calls with basal-like probability by CLIA lab vs. whole transcriptome RNA-seq from the trial cohort can be found in **pancreas_trial_samples.csv**.
